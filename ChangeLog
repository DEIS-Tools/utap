	* Enlarged "default domain" of a constant (since a constant is 
	  a normal integer, it has a domain)
	* Fixed problem with constant arguments to non-constant integer
	  reference parameters.
	* Fixed problem with array parameters
	* Fixed false assumption: Previously, the value of constants was
	  thought to be known. This is not always the case, since it might
	  depend on the parameters of a template. Values derived from such
	  constants are now disallowed in array sizes and integer ranges.
	* Fixed bug which caused some identifier expressions to be
	  marked as non-reference types.
	* Fixed bug in InternalBuilder which caused inline-ifs that mixed
          reference and non-reference types to fail
	* Fixed bug in InternalBuilder which caused a wrong offset to be
	  computed for constant arrays.
	* Fixed bug in range estimation for subtractions

2003-02-04  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Added min and max operators
	* Added new array constructs to old syntax
	* Fixed memory allocation bugs
	* Moved declaration of assert into error.h and removed assert.h
	  (due to conflicts with the system assert.h)
        * Fixed validation problems when loading ta/xta files
	* Made type checker detect possible division by zero
	* Fixed problem with empty <instantiation> and <system> tags

	* Cleaned up use of type_t
	* Changed addState to addLocation
	* Fixed/cleaned up handling of arguments in function calls and
	  template instantiations.

	  effect free.

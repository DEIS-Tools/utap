2003-04-06  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed several crasher bugs related to the parser and
	  error recovery
	* Added const version of SubExpression::operator[]
	* Removed the code which converted constraints to the 
	  normal form (x-y<c) - also removed the CONSTRAINT 
	  operation.
	* Added flag to expressionToString which indicates whether
	  to use = or := as the assignment operator.
	* Reimplemented type and symbol handling. Three new classes
	  (frame_t, type_t and symbol_t) have repaced the TypeSystem
	  and SymbolTable classes.
	* Added doxygen support
	* Added support for the visitor pattern to TimedAutomataSystem
	* Replaced the old TypeChecker class with two new classes: The
	  SystemBuilder class is used for creating a TimedAutomataSystem
	  with minimal type checking. The TypeChecker class (which 
	  implements the visitor pattern) type checks an existing 
	  TimedAutomataSystem. The new type checker no longer copies
	  the template on template instantiation.
	* Moved range checking to new RangeChecker class
	* Added support for tracking the position of expression in the
	  input file.
	* Added ExpressionProgram::empty() method
	* Added SubExpression::getSymbol(), SubExpression::isReferenceTo(),
	  and SubExpression::changesVariables().
	* Unified handling of processes and structs
	* Added warning for updates on edges without any effect

	* Enlarged "default domain" of a constant (since a constant is 
	  a normal integer, it has a domain)
	* Fixed problem with constant arguments to non-constant integer
	  reference parameters.
	* Fixed problem with array parameters
	* Fixed false assumption: Previously, the value of constants was
	  thought to be known. This is not always the case, since it might
	  depend on the parameters of a template. Values derived from such
	  constants are now disallowed in array sizes and integer ranges.
	* Fixed bug which caused some identifier expressions to be
	  marked as non-reference types.
	* Fixed bug in InternalBuilder which caused inline-ifs that mixed
          reference and non-reference types to fail
	* Fixed bug in InternalBuilder which caused a wrong offset to be
	  computed for constant arrays.
	* Fixed bug in range estimation for subtractions

2003-02-04  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Added min and max operators
	* Added new array constructs to old syntax
	* Fixed memory allocation bugs
	* Moved declaration of assert into error.h and removed assert.h
	  (due to conflicts with the system assert.h)
        * Fixed validation problems when loading ta/xta files
	* Made type checker detect possible division by zero
	* Fixed problem with empty <instantiation> and <system> tags

2003-01-30  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* C++ compatibility fixes
	* Windows fixes

2003-01-28  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Added support for +=, -=, etc.

2003-01-27  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Added pre/post decrement/increment operators
	* Made := and = behave the same
	* Cleaned up use of type_t
	* Changed addState to addLocation
	* Fixed/cleaned up handling of arguments in function calls and
	  template instantiations.
	* Added check to make sure that arguments to templates are side 
	  effect free.

2003-01-24  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed more segfaults
	* Fixed bug in throw statement

2003-01-18  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed XPath construction

2003-01-17  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed segfault in case of missing initial state

2003-01-13  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed C++ compatibility issues

2003-01-04  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed position tracking
	* Reimplemented symbol table for speed
	* Implemented copy constructor for TypeSystem
	* Fixed error handling problem in XML parser

2003-12-27  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Moved typecheck of assignment from procTransition() to
 	  procUpdate()
	* Added check for non-constant arguments to non-reference
	  paramters

2003-12-23  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Fixed lexer problem with 'broadcast' keyword
	* Added check for clock guards on transitions with urgent or
	  broadcast synchronisations 
	* Added check for non-reference clock and channel parameters

2002-12-20  Gerd Behrmann  <behrmann@cs.auc.dk>

	* Initial release
